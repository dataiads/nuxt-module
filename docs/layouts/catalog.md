# Catalog layout

The catalog layout contains a sidebar with filters allowing for the user to search through a catalog of products below the main product.

Multiple variations of this template exist, most of them dealing with the positioning of the reco slider and the cross-sell block.

The basic version of the catalog looks as follows :

## catalog-high-filters
This can be combined with the [light version of the main product](https://dataiads.github.io/nuxt-module/layouts/light-main-product.html) to make a more "catalog-centric" page.
