# Layouts

Changing the page template is nearly as easy as changing any other setting.
In sopme cases, you may need to adjust the page's CSS to fit well with the new page structure.

Layouts are split into two main categories :
- Catalog
- Light

[Catalog](https://dataiads.github.io/nuxt-module/layouts/catalog.html) contains a sidebar containing filters, with a filter results dipslayed below the main product.

[Light](https://dataiads.github.io/nuxt-module/layouts/light.html) contains no sidebar and filtering options.

There is a list of different variants linked to these two categories, which often have to do with positioning elements like the slider or cross-sell block in different positions on the page.

There is also a possibility of integrating a [light version of the main product](https://dataiads.github.io/nuxt-module/layouts/light-main-product.html).
