# Light main product

This is an alternative to the main product block that can be used for making an alternative version of the main product block.

This is used for doing things like making a variation with a condensed main product, or displaying different information.

To enable this, create a boolean setting in the confugration named `useLightMainProduct` and set it to `true`.
